2024-10-24 17:14:59,331 - INFO - clean content - clean_content="TLDR; They turned 3D images into vector embeddings, saving preprocessing time and reducing training data sizes. Over 70 million Computed Tomography exams are conducted each year in the USA alone, but that data wasn't effective for Google's training. Google Research had embedding APIs for radiology, digital pathology, and dermatology-- but all of these are limited to 2D imaging. Physicians typically rely on 3D imaging for more complex diagnostics. Why? CT scans have a 3D structure, meaning larger file sizes, and the need for more data than 2D images. Looking through engineering blogs, they just released something to finally work with 3D medical data. It's called CT Foundation-- it turns CT scans to small and information-rich embeddings to train AI for cheap How? Exams are taken in standard medical imaging format (DICOM) and turned into vectors with 1,408 values‚Äî key details captured include organs, tissues, and abnormalities. These concise embeddings can then be used to train AI models, such as logistic regression or multilayer perceptrons, using much less data compared to typical models that take 3D images and require preprocessing. The final classifier is smaller, reducing compute costs so training is more efficient and affordable. Final Results? CT Foundation was evaluated for data efficiency across seven tasks to classify: - intracranial hemorrhage - chest and heart calcifications - lung cancer prediction - suspicious abdominal lesions - nephrolithiasis - abdominal aortic aneurysm, and - body parts Despite limited training data, the models achieved over 0.8 AUC on all but one of the more challenging tasks, meaning a strong predictive performance and accuracy. The model, using 1,408-dimensional embeddings, required only a CPU for training, all within a Colab Python notebook. TLDR; Google Research launched a tool to effectively train AI on 3D CT scans, by converting them into compact 1,408-dimensional embeddings for efficient model training. It's called CT Foundation, requires less data and processing, and achieved over 0.8 AUC in seven classification tasks, demonstrating strong predictive performance with minimal compute resources. There's a colab notebook available.

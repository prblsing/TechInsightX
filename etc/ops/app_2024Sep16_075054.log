I have a fixed number of images (a variable number, taken in high resol DSLR). My query images are going to be low quality images of the same taken in a phone camera instead. The query image will contain other background and objects along with the object of interest, unlike the DSLR image. My aim is to do image authorization, I wanted to first start with an Image search and then proceed with feature extraction and matching. Would you recommend FAISS, Azure AI search, or dinov2 embeddings in a vector db. I did the dinov2 embeddings in Qdrant, but it failed in 3 cases, that the query image didn\'t pick the right image from the database. I\'m also looking at ways to reduce the search by maybe clustering by visual ranking, or Graph neural networks.

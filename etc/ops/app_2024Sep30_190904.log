ZipNN is an open-source Python library, available under the MIT license, tailored for compressing AI models without losing accuracy (similar to Zip but tailored for Neural Networks). It uses lossless compression to reduce model sizes by 33%, saving third of your download time. ZipNN has a plugin to HF so you only need to add one line of code. Check it out here: There are already a few compressed models with ZipNN on Hugging Face, and it's straightforward to upload more if you're interested. The newest one is Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct-ZipNN-Compressed Take a look at this Kaggle notebook: For a practical example of Llama-3.2 you can at this Kaggle notebook: More examples are available in the ZipNN repo: &#32; submitted by &#32; /u/Candid_Raccoon2102 [link] &#32; [comments]"

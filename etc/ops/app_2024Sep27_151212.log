Each colored subword represents a distinct\xa0token.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>What is tokenization?</strong></h3><p>In computer science, we refer to human languages, like English and Mandarin, as ‚Äúnatural‚Äù languages. In contrast, languages designed to interact with computers, like Assembly and LISP, are called ‚Äúmachine‚Äù languages, following strict syntactic rules that leave little room for interpretation. While computers excel at processing their own highly structured languages, they struggle with the messiness of human language.</p><p>Language\u200a‚Äî\u200aespecially text\u200a‚Äî\u200amakes up most of our communication and knowledge storage. For example, the internet is mostly text. Large language models like <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude">Claude</a>, and <a href="https://www.llama.com/">Llama </a>are trained on enormous amounts of text\u200a‚Äî\u200aessentially all the text available online\u200a‚Äî\u200ausing sophisticated computational techniques. However, computers operate on numbers, not words or sentences. So, how do we bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding?</p><p>This is where <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> comes into play. NLP is a field that combines linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Whether translating text from English to French, summarizing articles, or engaging in conversation, NLP allows machines to produce meaningful outputs from textual\xa0inputs.</p><p>The first critical step in NLP is transforming raw text into a format that computers can work with effectively. This process is known as <strong>tokenization</strong>. Tokenization involves breaking down text into smaller, manageable units called <strong><em>tokens</em></strong>, which can be words, subwords, or even individual characters. Here‚Äôs how the process typically works:</p><ul><li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Before tokenizing, the text is standardized to ensure consistency. This may include converting all letters to lowercase, removing punctuation, and applying other normalization techniques.</li><li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> The standardized text is then split into tokens. For example, the sentence ‚ÄúThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog‚Äù can be tokenized into\xa0words:</li></ul><pre>[&quot;the&quot;, &quot;quick&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;fox&quot;, &quot;jumps&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;lazy&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;]</pre><ul><li><strong>Numerical representation:</strong> Since computers operate on numerical data, each token is converted into a numerical representation. This can be as simple as assigning a unique identifier to each token or as complex as creating multi-dimensional vectors that capture the token‚Äôs meaning and\xa0context.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mkvzSPMiX5FZcuQjFe2B6w.png" /><figcaption><em>Illustration inspired by ‚ÄúFigure 11.1 From text to vectors‚Äù from</em> <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition"><strong>Deep Learning with Python</strong> <em>by Fran√ßois\xa0Chollet</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Tokenization is more than just splitting text; it‚Äôs about preparing language data in a way that preserves meaning and context for computational models. Different tokenization methods can significantly impact how well a model understands and processes language.</p><p>In this article, we focus on text standardization and tokenization, exploring a few techniques and implementations. We‚Äôll lay the groundwork for converting text into numerical forms that machines can process\u200a‚Äî\u200aa crucial step toward advanced topics like word embeddings and language modeling that we‚Äôll tackle in future articles.</p><h3><strong>Text standardization</strong></h3><p>Consider these two sentences:</p><blockquote><em>1. </em>‚Äúdusk fell, i was gazing at the Sao Paulo skyline. Isnt urban life vibrant??‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote><em>2. </em>‚ÄúDusk fell; I gazed at the S√£o Paulo skyline. Isn‚Äôt urban life vibrant?‚Äù</blockquote><p>At first glance, these sentences convey a similar meaning. However, when processed by a computer, especially during tasks like tokenization or encoding, they can appear vastly different due to subtle variations:</p><ul><li><strong>Capitalization:</strong> ‚Äúdusk‚Äù vs.\xa0‚ÄúDusk‚Äù</li><li><strong>Punctuation:</strong> Comma vs. semicolon; presence of question\xa0marks</li><li><strong>Contractions:</strong> ‚ÄúIsnt‚Äù vs.\xa0‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt‚Äù</li><li><strong>Spelling and Special Characters:</strong> ‚ÄúSao Paulo‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúS√£o\xa0Paulo‚Äù</li></ul><p>These differences can significantly impact how algorithms interpret the text. For example, ‚ÄúIsnt‚Äù without an apostrophe may not be recognized as the contraction of ‚Äúis not‚Äù, and special characters like ‚Äú√£‚Äù in ‚ÄúS√£o‚Äù may be misinterpreted or cause encoding\xa0issues.</p><p><strong>Text standardization</strong> is a crucial preprocessing step in NLP that addresses these issues. By standardizing text, we reduce irrelevant variability and ensure that the data fed into models is consistent. This process is a form of feature engineering where we eliminate differences that are not meaningful for the task at\xa0hand.</p><p>A simple method for text standardization includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Converting to lowercase</strong>: Reduces discrepancies due to capitalization.</li><li><strong>Removing punctuation</strong>: Simplifies the text by eliminating punctuation marks.</li><li><strong>Normalizing special characters</strong>: Converts characters like ‚Äú√£‚Äù to their standard forms\xa0(‚Äúa‚Äù).</li></ul><p>Applying these steps to our sentences, we\xa0get:</p><blockquote><em>1. </em>‚Äúdusk fell i was gazing at the sao paulo skyline isnt urban life\xa0vibrant‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote><em>2. </em>‚Äúdusk fell i gazed at the sao paulo skyline isnt urban life\xa0vibrant‚Äù</blockquote><p>Now, the sentences are more uniform, highlighting only the meaningful differences in word choice (e.g., ‚Äúwas gazing at‚Äù vs. ‚Äúgazed\xa0at‚Äù).</p><p>While there are more advanced standardization techniques like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming"><strong>stemming</strong></a> (reducing words to their root forms) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatization"><strong>lemmatization</strong> </a>(reducing words to their dictionary form), this basic approach effectively minimizes superficial differences.</p><h4><strong>Python implementation of text standardization</strong></h4><p>Here‚Äôs how you can implement basic text standardization in\xa0Python:</p><pre>import re<br />import unicodedata<br /><br />def standardize_text(text:str) -&gt; str:<br />    # Convert text to lowercase<br />    text = text.lower()<br />    # Normalize unicode characters to ASCII<br />    text = unicodedata.normalize(\'NFKD\', text).encode(\'ascii\', \'ignore\').decode(\'utf-8\')<br />    # Remove punctuation<br />    text = re.sub(r\'[^\\w\\s]\', \'\', text)<br />    # Remove extra whitespace<br />    text = re.sub(r\'\\s+\', \' \', text).strip()<br />    return text<br /><br /># Example sentences<br />sentence1 = &quot;dusk fell, i was gazing at the Sao Paulo skyline. Isnt urban life vibrant??&quot;<br />sentence2 = &quot;Dusk fell; I gazed at the S√£o Paulo skyline. Isn\'t urban life vibrant?&quot;<br /><br /># Standardize sentences<br />std_sentence1 = standardize_text(sentence1)<br />std_sentence2 = standardize_text(sentence2)<br />print(std_sentence1)<br />print(std_sentence2)</pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre>dusk fell i was gazing at the sao paulo skyline isnt urban life vibrant<br />dusk fell i gazed at the sao paulo skyline isnt urban life vibrant</pre><p>By standardizing the text, we‚Äôve minimized differences that could confuse a computational model. The model can now focus on the variations between the sentences, such as the difference between ‚Äúwas gazing at‚Äù and ‚Äúgazed at‚Äù, rather than discrepancies like punctuation or capitalization.</p><h3>Tokenization</h3><p>After text standardization, the next critical step in natural language processing is <strong>tokenization</strong>. Tokenization involves breaking down the standardized text into smaller units called <strong><em>tokens</em></strong>. These tokens are the building blocks that models use to understand and generate human language. Tokenization prepares the text for vectorization, where each token is converted into numerical representations that machines can\xa0process.</p><p>We aim to convert sentences into a form that computers can efficiently and effectively handle. There are three common methods for tokenization:</p><h4><strong>1. Word-level tokenization</strong></h4><p>Splits text into individual words based on spaces and punctuation. It‚Äôs the most intuitive way to break down\xa0text.</p><pre>text = &quot;dusk fell i gazed at the sao paulo skyline isnt urban life vibrant&quot;<br />tokens = text.split()<br />print(tokens)</pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre>[\'dusk\', \'fell\', \'i\', \'gazed\', \'at\', \'the\', \'sao\', \'paulo\', \'skyline\', \'isnt\', \'urban\', \'life\', \'vibrant\']</pre><h4><strong>2. Character-level tokenization</strong></h4><p>Breaks text into individual characters, including letters and sometimes punctuation.</p><pre>text = &quot;Dusk fell&quot;<br />tokens = list(text)<br />print(tokens)</pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre>[\'D\', \'u\', \'s\', \'k\', \' \', \'f\', \'e\', \'l\', \'l\']</pre><h4><strong>3. Subword tokenization</strong></h4><p>Splits words into smaller, meaningful subword units. This method balances the granularity of character-level tokenization with the semantic richness of word-level tokenization. Algorithms like <strong>Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)</strong> and <strong>WordPiece</strong> fall under this category. For instance, the <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.44.2/en/model_doc/bert#transformers.BertTokenizer">BertTokenizer</a> tokenizes ‚ÄúI have a new GPU!‚Äù as\xa0follows:</p><pre>from transformers import BertTokenizer<br /><br />text = &quot;I have a new GPU!&quot;<br />tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;bert-base-uncased&quot;)<br />tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)<br />print(tokens)</pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre>[\'i\', \'have\', \'a\', \'new\', \'gp\', \'##u\', \'!\']</pre><p>Here, ‚ÄúGPU‚Äù is split into ‚Äúgp‚Äù and ‚Äú##u‚Äù, where ‚Äú##‚Äù indicates that ‚Äúu‚Äù is a continuation of the previous\xa0subword.</p><p>Subword tokenization offers a balanced approach between vocabulary size and semantic representation. By decomposing rare words into common subwords, it maintains a manageable vocabulary size without sacrificing meaning. Subwords carry semantic information that aids models in understanding context more effectively. This means models can process new or rare words by breaking them down into familiar subwords, increasing their ability to handle a wider range of language\xa0inputs.</p><p>For example, consider the word ‚Äúannoyingly‚Äù which might be rare in a training corpus. It can be decomposed into the subwords ‚Äúannoying‚Äù and ‚Äúly‚Äù. Both ‚Äúannoying‚Äù and ‚Äúly‚Äù appear more frequently on their own, and their combined meanings retain the essence of ‚Äúannoyingly‚Äù. This approach is especially beneficial in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language">agglutinative languages</a> like Turkish, where words can become exceedingly long by stringing together subwords to convey complex meanings.</p><p>Notice that the standardization step is often integrated into the tokenizer itself. Large language models use tokens as both inputs and outputs when processing text. Here‚Äôs a visual representation of tokens generated by Llama-3‚Äì8B on <a href="https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/">Tiktokenizer</a>:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h5G4o3Nhh0BzvYBX3SsBtw.png" /><figcaption><strong>Tiktokenizer</strong> example using <strong>Llama-3‚Äì8B</strong>. Each token is represented by a different color.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Hugging Face provides an excellent <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/tokenizer_summary">summary of the tokenizers</a> guide, in which I use some of its examples in this\xa0article.</p><p>Let‚Äôs now explore how different subword tokenization algorithms work. Note that all of those tokenization algorithms rely on some form of training which is usually done on the corpus the corresponding model will be trained\xa0on.</p><h3>Byte-Pair Encoding\xa0(BPE)</h3><p><strong>Byte-Pair Encoding</strong> is a subword tokenization method introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909">Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units</a> by Sennrich et al. in 2015. BPE starts with a base vocabulary consisting of all unique characters in the training data and iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of symbols\u200a‚Äî\u200awhich can be characters or sequences of characters\u200a‚Äî\u200ato form new subwords.

2024-09-27 15:30:17,251 - INFO - clean content - clean_content="Demystifying NLP: From Text to EmbeddingsTokenization example generated by Llama-3-8B. Each colored subword represents a distinct token.What is tokenization?In computer science, we refer to human languages, like English and Mandarin, as ‚Äúnatural‚Äù languages. In contrast, languages designed to interact with computers, like Assembly and LISP, are called ‚Äúmachine‚Äù languages, following strict syntactic rules that leave little room for interpretation. While computers excel at processing their own highly structured languages, they struggle with the messiness of human language.Language ‚Äî especially text ‚Äî makes up most of our communication and knowledge storage. For example, the internet is mostly text. Large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Llama are trained on enormous amounts of text ‚Äî essentially all the text available online ‚Äî using sophisticated computational techniques. However, computers operate on numbers, not words or sentences. So, how do we bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding?This is where Natural Language Processing (NLP) comes into play. NLP is a field that combines linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Whether translating text from English to French, summarizing articles, or engaging in conversation, NLP allows machines to produce meaningful outputs from textual inputs.The first critical step in NLP is transforming raw text into a format that computers can work with effectively. This process is known as tokenization. Tokenization involves breaking down text into smaller, manageable units called tokens, which can be words, subwords, or even individual characters. Here‚Äôs how the process typically works:Standardization: Before tokenizing, the text is standardized to ensure consistency. This may include converting all letters to lowercase, removing punctuation, and applying other normalization techniques.Tokenization: The standardized text is then split into tokens. For example, the sentence ‚ÄúThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog‚Äù can be tokenized into words:[&quot;the&quot;, &quot;quick&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;fox&quot;, &quot;jumps&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;lazy&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;]Numerical representation: Since computers operate on numerical data, each token is converted into a numerical representation. This can be as simple as assigning a unique identifier to each token or as complex as creating multi-dimensional vectors that capture the token‚Äôs meaning and context.Illustration inspired by ‚ÄúFigure 11.1 From text to vectors‚Äù from Deep Learning with Python by Fran√ßois CholletTokenization is more than just splitting text; it‚Äôs about preparing language data in a way that preserves meaning and context for computational models. Different tokenization methods can significantly impact how well a model understands and processes language.In this article, we focus on text standardization and tokenization, exploring a few techniques and implementations. We‚Äôll lay the groundwork for converting text into numerical forms that machines can process ‚Äî a crucial step toward advanced topics like word embeddings and language modeling that we‚Äôll tackle in future articles.Text standardizationConsider these two sentences:1. ‚Äúdusk fell, i was gazing at the Sao Paulo skyline. Isnt urban life vibrant??‚Äù2. ‚ÄúDusk fell; I gazed at the S√£o Paulo skyline. Isn‚Äôt urban life vibrant?‚ÄùAt first glance, these sentences convey a similar meaning. However, when processed by a computer, especially during tasks like tokenization or encoding, they can appear vastly different due to subtle variations:Capitalization: ‚Äúdusk‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúDusk‚ÄùPunctuation: Comma vs. semicolon; presence of question marksContractions: ‚ÄúIsnt‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt‚ÄùSpelling and Special Characters: ‚ÄúSao Paulo‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúS√£o Paulo‚ÄùThese differences can significantly impact how algorithms interpret the text. For example, ‚ÄúIsnt‚Äù without an apostrophe may not be recognized as the contraction of ‚Äúis not‚Äù, and special characters like ‚Äú√£‚Äù in ‚ÄúS√£o‚Äù may be misinterpreted or cause encoding issues.Text standardization is a crucial preprocessing step in NLP that addresses these issues. By standardizing text, we reduce irrelevant variability and ensure that the data fed into models is consistent. This process is a form of feature engineering where we eliminate differences that are not meaningful for the task at hand.A simple method for text standardization includes:Converting to lowercase: Reduces discrepancies due to capitalization.Removing punctuation: Simplifies the text by eliminating punctuation marks.Normalizing special characters: Converts characters like ‚Äú√£‚Äù to their standard forms (‚Äúa‚Äù).Applying these steps to our sentences, we get:1. ‚Äúdusk fell i was gazing at the sao paulo skyline isnt urban life vibrant‚Äù2. ‚Äúdusk fell i gazed at the sao paulo skyline isnt urban life vibrant‚ÄùNow, the sentences are more uniform, highlighting only the meaningful differences in word choice (e.g., ‚Äúwas gazing at‚Äù vs. ‚Äúgazed at‚Äù).While there are more advanced standardization techniques like stemming (reducing words to their root forms) and lemmatization (reducing words to their dictionary form), this basic approach effectively minimizes superficial differences.Python implementation of text standardizationHere‚Äôs how you can implement basic text standardization in Python:import reimport unicodedatadef standardize_text(text:str) -&gt; str: # Convert text to lowercase text = text.lower() # Normalize unicode characters to ASCII text = unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', text).encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode('utf-8') # Remove punctuation text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', text) # Remove extra whitespace text = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text).strip() return text# Example sentencessentence1 = &quot;dusk fell, i was gazing at the Sao Paulo skyline. Isnt urban life vibrant??&quot;sentence2 = &quot;Dusk fell; I gazed at the S√£o Paulo skyline. Isn't urban life vibrant?&quot;# Standardize sentencesstd_sentence1 = standardize_text(sentence1)std_sentence2 = standardize_text(sentence2)print(std_sentence1)print(std_sentence2)Output:dusk fell i was gazing at the sao paulo skyline isnt urban life vibrantdusk fell i gazed at the sao paulo skyline isnt urban life vibrantBy standardizing the text, we‚Äôve minimized differences that could confuse a computational model. The model can now focus on the variations between the sentences, such as the difference between ‚Äúwas gazing at‚Äù and ‚Äúgazed at‚Äù, rather than discrepancies like punctuation or capitalization.TokenizationAfter text standardization, the next critical step in natural language processing is tokenization. Tokenization involves breaking down the standardized text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens are the building blocks that models use to understand and generate human language. Tokenization prepares the text for vectorization, where each token is converted into numerical representations that machines can process.We aim to convert sentences into a form that computers can efficiently and effectively handle. There are three common methods for tokenization:1. Word-level tokenizationSplits text into individual words based on spaces and punctuation. It‚Äôs the most intuitive way to break down text.text = &quot;dusk fell i gazed at the sao paulo skyline isnt urban life vibrant&quot;tokens = text.split()print(tokens)Output:['dusk', 'fell', 'i', 'gazed', 'at', 'the', 'sao', 'paulo', 'skyline', 'isnt', 'urban', 'life', 'vibrant']2. Character-level tokenizationBreaks text into individual characters, including letters and sometimes punctuation.text = &quot;Dusk fell&quot;tokens = list(text)print(tokens)Output:['D', 'u', 's', 'k', ' ', 'f', 'e', 'l', 'l']3. Subword tokenizationSplits words into smaller, meaningful subword units. This method balances the granularity of character-level tokenization with the semantic richness of word-level tokenization. Algorithms like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece fall under this category. For instance, the BertTokenizer tokenizes ‚ÄúI have a new GPU!‚Äù as follows:from transformers import BertTokenizertext = &quot;I have a new GPU!&quot;tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;bert-base-uncased&quot;)tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)print(tokens)Output:['i', 'have', 'a', 'new', 'gp', '##u', '!']Here, ‚ÄúGPU‚Äù is split into ‚Äúgp‚Äù and ‚Äú##u‚Äù, where ‚Äú##‚Äù indicates that ‚Äúu‚Äù is a continuation of the previous subword.Subword tokenization offers a balanced approach between vocabulary size and semantic representation. By decomposing rare words into common subwords, it maintains a manageable vocabulary size without sacrificing meaning. Subwords carry semantic information that aids models in understanding context more effectively. This means models can process new or rare words by breaking them down into familiar subwords, increasing their ability to handle a wider range of language inputs.For example, consider the word ‚Äúannoyingly‚Äù which might be rare in a training corpus. It can be decomposed into the subwords ‚Äúannoying‚Äù and ‚Äúly‚Äù. Both ‚Äúannoying‚Äù and ‚Äúly‚Äù appear more frequently on their own, and their combined meanings retain the essence of ‚Äúannoyingly‚Äù. This approach is especially beneficial in agglutinative languages like Turkish, where words can become exceedingly long by stringing together subwords to convey complex meanings.Notice that the standardization step is often integrated into the tokenizer itself. Large language models use tokens as both inputs and outputs when processing text. Here‚Äôs a visual representation of tokens generated by Llama-3‚Äì8B on Tiktokenizer:Tiktokenizer example using Llama-3‚Äì8B. Each token is represented by a different color.Additionally, Hugging Face provides an excellent summary of the tokenizers guide, in which I use some of its examples in this article.Let‚Äôs now explore how different subword tokenization algorithms work. Note that all of those tokenization algorithms rely on some form of training which is usually done on the corpus the corresponding model will be trained on.Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)Byte-Pair Encoding is a subword tokenization method introduced in Neural Machine Translation of Rare Words with Subword Units by Sennrich et al. in 2015. BPE starts with a base vocabulary consisting of all unique characters in the training data and iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of symbols ‚Äî which can be characters or sequences of characters ‚Äî to form new subwords. This process continues until the vocabulary reaches a predefined size, which is a hyperparameter you choose before training.Suppose we have the following words with their frequencies:‚Äúhug‚Äù (10 occurrences)‚Äúpug‚Äù (5 occurrences)‚Äúpun‚Äù (12 occurrences)‚Äúbun‚Äù (4 occurrences)‚Äúhugs‚Äù (5 occurrences)Our initial base vocabulary consists of the following characters: [‚Äúh‚Äù, ‚Äúu‚Äù, ‚Äúg‚Äù, ‚Äúp‚Äù, ‚Äún‚Äù, ‚Äúb‚Äù, ‚Äús‚Äù].We split the words into individual characters:‚Äúh‚Äù ‚Äúu‚Äù ‚Äúg‚Äù (hug)‚Äúp‚Äù ‚Äúu‚Äù ‚Äúg‚Äù (pug)‚Äúp‚Äù ‚Äúu‚Äù ‚Äún‚Äù (pun)‚Äúb‚Äù ‚Äúu‚Äù ‚Äún‚Äù (bun)‚Äúh‚Äù ‚Äúu‚Äù ‚Äúg‚Äù ‚Äús‚Äù (hugs)Next, we count the frequency of each symbol pair:‚Äúh u‚Äù: 15 times (from ‚Äúhug‚Äù and ‚Äúhugs‚Äù)‚Äúu g‚Äù: 20 times (from ‚Äúhug‚Äù, ‚Äúpug‚Äù, ‚Äúhugs‚Äù)‚Äúp u‚Äù: 17 times (from ‚Äúpug‚Äù, ‚Äúpun‚Äù)‚Äúu n‚Äù: 16 times (from ‚Äúpun‚Äù, ‚Äúbun‚Äù)The most frequent pair is ‚Äúu g‚Äù (20 times), so we merge ‚Äúu‚Äù and ‚Äúg‚Äù to form ‚Äúug‚Äù and update our words:‚Äúh‚Äù ‚Äúug‚Äù (hug)‚Äúp‚Äù ‚Äúug‚Äù (pug)‚Äúp‚Äù ‚Äúu‚Äù ‚Äún‚Äù (pun)‚Äúb‚Äù ‚Äúu‚Äù ‚Äún‚Äù (bun)‚Äúh‚Äù ‚Äúug‚Äù ‚Äús‚Äù (hugs)We continue this process, merging the next most frequent pairs, such as ‚Äúu n‚Äù into ‚Äúun‚Äù, until we reach our desired vocabulary size.BPE controls the vocabulary size by specifying the number of merge operations. Frequent words remain intact, reducing the need for extensive memorization. And, rare or unseen words can be represented through combinations of known subwords. It‚Äôs used in models like GPT and RoBERTa.The Hugging Face tokenizers library provides a fast and flexible way to train and use tokenizers, including BPE.Training a BPE TokenizerHere‚Äôs how to train a BPE tokenizer on a sample dataset:from tokenizers import Tokenizerfrom tokenizers.models import BPEfrom tokenizers.trainers import BpeTrainerfrom tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import Whitespace# Initialize a tokenizertokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE())# Set the pre-tokenizer to split on whitespacetokenizer.pre_tokenizer = Whitespace()# Initialize a trainer with desired vocabulary sizetrainer = BpeTrainer(vocab_size=1000, min_frequency=2, special_tokens=[&quot;[UNK]&quot;, &quot;[CLS]&quot;, &quot;[SEP]&quot;, &quot;[PAD]&quot;, &quot;[MASK]&quot;])# Files to train onfiles = [&quot;path/to/your/dataset.txt&quot;]# Train the tokenizertokenizer.train(files, trainer)# Save the tokenizertokenizer.save(&quot;bpe-tokenizer.json&quot;)Using the trained BPE Tokenizer:from tokenizers import Tokenizer# Load the tokenizertokenizer = Tokenizer.from_file(&quot;bpe-tokenizer.json&quot;)# Encode a text inputencoded = tokenizer.encode(&quot;I have a new GPU!&quot;)print(&quot;Tokens:&quot;, encoded.tokens)print(&quot;IDs:&quot;, encoded.ids)Output:Tokens: ['I', 'have', 'a', 'new', 'GP', 'U', '!']IDs: [12, 45, 7, 89, 342, 210, 5]WordPieceWordPiece is another subword tokenization algorithm, outlined by Schuster and Nakajima in 2012 and popularized by models like BERT.

2024-10-23 06:15:08,677 - INFO - clean content - clean_content='Hey Reddit! We’re working on something that we think could make model discovery a LOT easier for everyone: a model recommendation system where you can just type what you\'re working on in plain English, and it\'ll suggest the best AI models for your project. 🎉 💡 How it works: The main idea is that you can literally describe your project in natural language, like: "I need a model to generate summaries of medical research papers." "I\'m building a chatbot for customer support." "I want a model that can analyze product reviews for sentiment." And based on that input, the system will recommend the best models for the job! No deep diving into technical specs, no complex filters—just solid recommendations based on what you need. 🌟 What else we’re building: Alongside the model suggestions, we’re adding features to make the platform super user-friendly: Detailed model insights: You’ll still get all the technical info, like performance metrics, architecture, and popularity, to compare models. Advanced search & filters: If you’re more hands-on, you can filter models by task, framework, or tags. Personalized suggestions: The system will get smarter over time and offer more relevant suggestions based on your past usage. Why we need your feedback: We want this platform to actually solve problems for people in the AI/ML space, and that’s where you come in! 🙌 Does a tool like this sound helpful to you? What features do you think are missing from model platforms like Hugging Face? Are there any specific features you’d want to see, like performance comparisons or customization options? How could we make the natural language input even more useful for recommending models? TL;DR: We’re building a tool where you can just describe your project in plain English, and it’ll recommend the best AI models for you. No need for complex searches—just type what you need! Looking for your feedback on what you\'d want to see or any features you think are missing from current platforms like Hugging Face. We\'d love to hear your thoughts and ideas! What would make this platform super useful for you? Let us know what you think could improve the model discovery process, or what’s lacking in existing platforms! Thanks in advance, Reddit! 😊   submitted by   /u/O2MINS [link]   [comments]'

The workshop will explore how AI is transforming music creation, recognition, education, and more. Topics include AI-driven composition, sound design, legal and ethical challenges, and AI‚Äôs impact on musicians‚Äô careers.</p> <p>Submissions (up to 6 pages) are welcome until November 22, 2024. Work in progress is encouraged! </p> <p><strong>Workshop Summary</strong></p> <p>This one-day workshop will explore the dynamic intersection of artificial intelligence and music. It explores how AI is transforming music creation, recognition, and education, ethical and legal implications, as well as business opportunities. We will investigate how AI is changing the music industry and education‚Äîfrom composition to performance, production, collaboration, and audience experience. Participants will gain insights into the technological challenges in music and how AI can enhance creativity, enabling musicians and producers to push the boundaries of their art. The workshop will cover topics such as AI-driven music composition, where algorithms generate melodies, harmonies, and even full orchestral arrangements. We will discuss how AI tools assist in sound design, remixing, and mastering, allowing for new sonic possibilities and efficiencies in music production. Additionally, we\'ll examine AI\'s impact on music education and the careers of musicians, exploring advanced learning tools and teaching methods. AI technologies are increasingly adopted in the music and entertainment industry. The workshop will also discuss the legal and ethical implications of AI in music, including questions of authorship, originality, and the evolving role of human artists in an increasingly automated world. This workshop is designed for AI researchers, musicians, producers, and educators interested in the current status and future of AI in music.</p> <p><strong>Call for Papers</strong></p> <p>Submissions should be a maximum of 6 pages. Work in progress is welcome. Authors are encouraged to include descriptions of their prototype implementations. Additionally, authors are encouraged to interact with workshop attendees by including posters or demonstrations at the end of the workshop.

2024-10-19 20:20:46,926 - INFO - Input content - content='<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I recently got my hands on a Sophon AI accelerator and wanted to share some strange findings. I was testing the ResNet50 model in FP32 mode (32-bit floating-point) on both the Sophon and an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. I used the exact same ONNX model and dataset to keep things fair. Here\'s what I observed: -NVIDIA RTX 4090 (FP32): 76.7% accuracy; -Sophon (FP32): 73.2% accuracy</p> <p>I was surprised to see that the Sophon had a noticeable drop in accuracy compared to the NVIDIA GPU, even though both were running in FP32 mode. Isn\'t FP32 supposed to give us the highest precision? I double-checked everything: -Same model and weights -Same dataset -Same preprocessing steps</p> <p>But the accuracy gap is still there. I\'m wondering why there\'s such a significant difference. Could it be due to Sophon\'s hardware architecture or how it handles computations internally? Has anyone else experienced something like this with the Sophon accelerator? Any ideas on what might be causing the lower accuracy in FP32 mode? Just thought I\'d share my experience and see if anyone has insights.

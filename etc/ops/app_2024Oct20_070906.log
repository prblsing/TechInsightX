I was testing the ResNet50 model in FP32 mode (32-bit floating-point) on both the Sophon and an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. I used the exact same ONNX model and dataset to keep things fair. Here\'s what I observed: -NVIDIA RTX 4090 (FP32): 76.7% accuracy; -Sophon (FP32): 73.2% accuracy</p> <p>I was surprised to see that the Sophon had a noticeable drop in accuracy compared to the NVIDIA GPU, even though both were running in FP32 mode. Isn\'t FP32 supposed to give us the highest precision? I double-checked everything: -Same model and weights -Same dataset -Same preprocessing steps</p> <p>But the accuracy gap is still there. I\'m wondering why there\'s such a significant difference. Could it be due to Sophon\'s hardware architecture or how it handles computations internally? Has anyone else experienced something like this with the Sophon accelerator? Any ideas on what might be causing the lower accuracy in FP32 mode?

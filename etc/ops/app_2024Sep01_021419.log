MultiMed consists of 2.56 million samples across ten medical modalities such as medical reports, pathology, genomics, and protein data. A Foundation model for generating chest X-ray images This paper presents a latent diffusion model pre-trained on pairs of natural images and text descriptors to generate diverse and visually plausible synthetic chest X-ray images whose appearance can be controlled with free-form medical text prompts. MEDSAGE: Medical Dialogue Summarization The paper leverage the incontext learning capabilities of LLMs and instruct them to generate ASR-like errors based on a few available medical dialogue examples with audio recordings. Knowledge Graphs for Radiology Report Generation The paper introduces a system, named ReXKG, which extracts structured information from processed reports to construct a comprehensive radiology knowledge graph.

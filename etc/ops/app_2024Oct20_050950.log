The workshop will explore how AI is transforming music creation, recognition, education, and more. Topics include AI-driven composition, sound design, legal and ethical challenges, and AI‚Äôs impact on musicians‚Äô careers.</p> <p>Submissions (up to 6 pages) are welcome until November 22, 2024. Work in progress is encouraged! </p> <p><strong>Workshop Summary</strong></p> <p>This one-day workshop will explore the dynamic intersection of artificial intelligence and music. It explores how AI is transforming music creation, recognition, and education, ethical and legal implications, as well as business opportunities. We will investigate how AI is changing the music industry and education‚Äîfrom composition to performance, production, collaboration, and audience experience. Participants will gain insights into the technological challenges in music and how AI can enhance creativity, enabling musicians and producers to push the boundaries of their art. The workshop will cover topics such as AI-driven music composition, where algorithms generate melodies, harmonies, and even full orchestral arrangements. We will discuss how AI tools assist in sound design, remixing, and mastering, allowing for new sonic possibilities and efficiencies in music production. Additionally, we\'ll examine AI\'s impact on music education and the careers of musicians, exploring advanced learning tools and teaching methods. AI technologies are increasingly adopted in the music and entertainment industry. The workshop will also discuss the legal and ethical implications of AI in music, including questions of authorship, originality, and the evolving role of human artists in an increasingly automated world. This workshop is designed for AI researchers, musicians, producers, and educators interested in the current status and future of AI in music.</p> <p><strong>Call for Papers</strong></p> <p>Submissions should be a maximum of 6 pages. Work in progress is welcome. Authors are encouraged to include descriptions of their prototype implementations.

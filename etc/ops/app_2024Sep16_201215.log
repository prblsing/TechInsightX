Based on what I understand of the field, I want to prioritize concerns about people with disability having the amount of autonomy and independence they desire, with the amount of support necessary to have opportunities and outcomes comparable to people without disabilities. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that much of the technology that was originally developed to aid people with disabilities is assistive to all people, such as automatic doors.</p><h3>AI as a\xa0tool</h3><p>So, what role can AI really play in this objective? Is AI a net good for people with disabilities? Technology in general, not just AI related development, has been applied in a number of ways to provide autonomy and independence to people with disabilities that would not otherwise be possible.

Turns out, quite a bit of really interesting scholarly research has already been done on the question and continues to be released. I‚Äôm going to give a brief overview of a few key areas and provide more sources if you happen to be interested in a deeper dive in any of\xa0them.</p><h3>Positives</h3><h4>Neurological and Communication Issues</h4><p>This seems like it ought to be a good wheelhouse for AI tools. LLMs have great usefulness for restating, rephrasing, or summarizing texts. When individuals struggle with reading long texts/concentration, having the ability to generate accurate summaries can make the difference between a text‚Äôs themes being accessible to those people or not. This isn‚Äôt necessarily a substitution for the whole text, but just might be a tool augmenting the reader‚Äôs understanding. (Like Cliff Notes, but for the way they‚Äôre supposed to be used.) I wouldn‚Äôt recommend things like asking LLMs direct questions about the meaning of a passage, because that is more likely to produce error or inaccuracies, but summarizing a text that already exists is a good use\xa0case.</p><p>Secondarily, people with difficulty in either producing or consuming spoken communication can get support from AI tools. The technologies can either take spoken text and generate highly accurate automatic transcriptions, which may be easier for people with forms of aphasia to comprehend, or it can allow a person who struggles with speaking to write a text and convert this to a highly realistic sounding human spoken voice. (Really, AI synthetic voices are becoming so amazing recently!)</p><p>This is not even getting into the ways that AI can help people with hearing impairment, either! Hearing aids can use models to identify and isolate the sounds the user wants to focus on, and diminish distractions or background noise. Anyone who‚Äôs used active noise canceling is benefiting from this kind of technology, and it‚Äôs a great example of things that are helpful for people with and without disabilities both.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adi-Maaita/publication/378042331_Speech_Recognition_Utilizing_Deep_Learning_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Latest_Developments/links/65cb6678790074549783aa83/Speech-Recognition-Utilizing-Deep-Learning-A-Systematic-Review-of-the-Latest-Developments.pdf">Speech Recognition Utilizing Deep Learning: A Systematic Review of the Latest Developments (Mar\xa02024)</a></li></ul><h4>Vision and\xa0Images</h4><p>For people with visual impairments, there may be barriers to digital participation, including things like poorly designed websites for screen readers, as well as the lack of alt text describing the contents of images.

I don‚Äôt mean necessarily technologies using neural implants, although that kind of thing is being studied, but there are many models that learn the physics of human movement to help computerized powered prosthetics work better for people.

However, we should also spend some time discussing the areas where AI can be detrimental for people with disabilities and our society at large. Most of these areas are about the cultural production using AI, and I think they are predominantly caused by the fact that these models replicate and reinforce social biases and discrimination.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Because our social structures don‚Äôt prioritize or highlight people with disabilities and their needs, models don‚Äôt either. Our society is shot through with ableism and this comes out in texts produced by AI. We can explicitly try to correct for that in prompt engineering, but a lot of people won‚Äôt spend the time or think to do\xa0that.</li><li>Similarly, images generated by AI models tend to erase all kinds of communities that are not dominant culturally or prioritized in media, including people with disabilities. The more these models use training data that includes representation of people with disabilities in positive context, the better this will get, but there is always a natural tension between representation proportions being true to life and having more representation because we want to have better visibility and not\xa0erasure.</li></ul><h4>Data Privacy and\xa0Ethics</h4><p>This area has two major themes that have negative potential for people with disabilities.</p><ul><li>First, there is a high risk of AI being used to make assumptions about desires and capabilities of people with disabilities, leading to discrimination. As with any group, asking AI what the group might prefer, need, or find desirable is no substitute for actually getting that community involved in decisions that will affect them. But it‚Äôs easy and lazy for people to just ‚Äúask AI‚Äù instead, and that is undoubtedly going to happen at\xa0times.</li><li>Second, data privacy is a complicated topic here. Specifically, when someone is using accessibility technologies, such as a screen reader for a cell phone or webpage, this can create inferred data about disability status. If that data is not carefully protected, the disability status of an individual, or the perceived status if the inference is wrong, can be a liability that will subject the person to risks of discrimination in other areas. We need to ensure that whether or not someone is using an accessibility tool or feature is regarded as sensitive personal data just like other information about\xa0them.</li></ul><h4>Bias in Medical Treatment</h4><p>When the medical community starts using AI in their work, we should take a close look at the side effects for marginalized communities including people with disabilities. Similarly to how LLM use can mean the actual voices of people with disabilities are overlooked in important decision making, if medical professionals are using LLMs to advise on the diagnosis or therapies for disabilities, this advice will be affected by the social and cultural negative biases that these models\xa0carry.</p><p>This might mean that non-stereotypical or uncommon presentations of disability may be overlooked or ignored, because models necessarily struggle to understand outliers and exceptional cases. It may also mean that patients have difficulty convincing providers of their lived experience when it runs counter to what a model expects or predicts. As I‚Äôve discussed in other work, people can become too confident in the accuracy of machine learning models, and human perspectives can be seen as less trustworthy in comparison, even when this is not a justifiable assertion.</p><h3>Access to technologies</h3><p>There are quite a few other technologies I haven‚Äôt had time to cover here, but I do want to make note that the mere existence of a technology is not the same thing as people with disabilities having easy, affordable access to these things to actually use. People with disabilities are often disadvantaged economically, in large part because of unnecessary barriers to economic participation, so many of the exceptional advances are not actually accessible to lots of the people who might need them. This is important to recognize as a problem our society needs to take responsibility for\u200a‚Äî\u200aas with other areas of healthcare in the United States in particular, we do a truly terrible job meeting people‚Äôs needs for the care and tools that would allow them to live their best lives and participate in the economy in the way they otherwise could.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>This is only a cursory review of some of the key issues in this space, and I think it‚Äôs an important topic for those of us working in machine learning to be aware of. The technologies we build have benefits and risks both for marginalized populations, including people with disabilities, and our responsibility is to take this into account as we work and do our best to mitigate those\xa0risks.</p><h3>Further Reading</h3><p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2020.571955/full?ref=blog.mondato.com">https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2020.571955/full?ref=blog.mondato.com</a></p><p><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/09/national-novel-writing-month-ai-bots-controversy.html">https://slate.com/technology/2024/09/national-novel-writing-month-ai-bots-controversy.html</a></p><p><a href="https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/jflowers.cfm">https://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/jflowers.cfm</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=0d5ab06ec140" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/disability-accessibility-and-ai-0d5ab06ec140">Disability, Accessibility, and AI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com">Towards Data Science</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>'

The more these models use training data that includes representation of people with disabilities in positive context, the better this will get, but there is always a natural tension between representation proportions being true to life and having more representation because we want to have better visibility and not erasure.Data Privacy and EthicsThis area has two major themes that have negative potential for people with disabilities.First, there is a high risk of AI being used to make assumptions about desires and capabilities of people with disabilities, leading to discrimination. As with any group, asking AI what the group might prefer, need, or find desirable is no substitute for actually getting that community involved in decisions that will affect them. But it‚Äôs easy and lazy for people to just ‚Äúask AI‚Äù instead, and that is undoubtedly going to happen at times.Second, data privacy is a complicated topic here. Specifically, when someone is using accessibility technologies, such as a screen reader for a cell phone or webpage, this can create inferred data about disability status. If that data is not carefully protected, the disability status of an individual, or the perceived status if the inference is wrong, can be a liability that will subject the person to risks of discrimination in other areas. We need to ensure that whether or not someone is using an accessibility tool or feature is regarded as sensitive personal data just like other information about them.Bias in Medical TreatmentWhen the medical community starts using AI in their work, we should take a close look at the side effects for marginalized communities including people with disabilities. Similarly to how LLM use can mean the actual voices of people with disabilities are overlooked in important decision making, if medical professionals are using LLMs to advise on the diagnosis or therapies for disabilities, this advice will be affected by the social and cultural negative biases that these models carry.This might mean that non-stereotypical or uncommon presentations of disability may be overlooked or ignored, because models necessarily struggle to understand outliers and exceptional cases. It may also mean that patients have difficulty convincing providers of their lived experience when it runs counter to what a model expects or predicts. As I‚Äôve discussed in other work, people can become too confident in the accuracy of machine learning models, and human perspectives can be seen as less trustworthy in comparison, even when this is not a justifiable assertion.Access to technologiesThere are quite a few other technologies I haven‚Äôt had time to cover here, but I do want to make note that the mere existence of a technology is not the same thing as people with disabilities having easy, affordable access to these things to actually use. People with disabilities are often disadvantaged economically, in large part because of unnecessary barriers to economic participation, so many of the exceptional advances are not actually accessible to lots of the people who might need them. This is important to recognize as a problem our society needs to take responsibility for ‚Äî as with other areas of healthcare in the United States in particular, we do a truly terrible job meeting people‚Äôs needs for the care and tools that would allow them to live their best lives and participate in the economy in the way they otherwise could.ConclusionsThis is only a cursory review of some of the key issues in this space, and I think it‚Äôs an important topic for those of us working in machine learning to be aware of. The technologies we build have benefits and risks both for marginalized populations, including people with disabilities, and our responsibility is to take this into account as we work and do our best to mitigate those risks.Further Reading Accessibility, and AI was originally published in Towards Data Science on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.'

The summary is apt. o1 looks to be a very impressive improvement. At the same time, it reveals the remaining gaps: degradation with increasing composition length, 100x cost, and huge degradation when "retrieval" is hampered via obfuscation of names. But, I wonder if this is close enough. e.g. this type of model is at least sufficient to provide synthetic data / supervision to train a model that can fill these gaps. If so, it won\'t take long to find out, IMHO. Also the authors have some spicy footnotes. e.g. : "The rich irony of researchers using tax payer provided research funds to pay private companies like OpenAI to evaluate their private commercial models is certainly not lost on us."   submitted by   /u/marojejian [link]   [comments]'
